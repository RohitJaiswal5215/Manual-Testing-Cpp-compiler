 Manual Testing – Cpp Compiler Project

## This repository contains the **Manual Testing project for a C++ Compiler application**.  
The purpose of this project is to validate the functionality, usability, and reliability of the C++ Compiler by designing and executing comprehensive **test cases** and documenting defects.  



## Project Overview
- Performed **requirement analysis** to identify test conditions.  
- Designed **test scenarios and test cases** covering functional and negative flows.  
- Executed manual tests on different inputs (valid/invalid C++ programs).  
- Documented findings in **Test Reports** and **Defect Logs**.  
- Ensured quality using **Equivalence Partitioning** and **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**.  



##  Tools & Skills Used
- **Testing Types:** Functional Testing, Usability Testing, Boundary Value Testing  
- **Techniques:** Equivalence Partitioning (EP), BVA, Negative Testing  
- **Documentation:** Test Plan, Test Cases, Execution Reports, Defect Logs  
- **Tools:** MS Excel / Google Sheets, GitHub for version control  
- **Knowledge Areas:** SDLC, STLC, Requirement Analysis  



##  Testing Deliverables
1. **Test Plan** – Scope, objectives, testing approach, responsibilities  
2. **Test Scenarios** – High-level test conditions for compiler functionalities  
3. **Test Cases** – Detailed step-by-step test cases with expected vs actual results  
4. **Execution Report** – Test results summary (Pass/Fail)  
5. **Defect Log** – Identified bugs with severity, priority, and reproduction steps
